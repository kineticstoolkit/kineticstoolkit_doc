# Exercise: Indexing lists 2

You are happy with the function `calculate_step_length` you wrote in the [previous exercise](python_lists_indexing_exercise1.md), but sometimes, you encountered an IndexError:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]
def calculate_step_length(y, step):
    return y[step + 1] - y[step]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [raises-exception]
# y-coordinates of each heel strike, in meters
y = [0.13, 0.72, 1.29, 1.93, 2.55, 3.12, 3.71, 4.34, 4.95, 5.56]

calculate_step_length(y, 9)
```

**Question 1)** Explain why this call produces an IndexError.

:::{toggle}
This happens because to calculate a step length, two consecutive heel strikes are needed. To calculate the length of step 9, heel strikes 9 and 10 are needed. However, the last element of `y` is at index 9.

One way to avoid this error is to check that the list will not be indexed out of its range, before calculating the step length.
:::

**Question 2)** Modify your function so that instead of producing this error, it simply returns 0.

:::{good-practice} Invalid data
For this example, we ask you to return 0 for invalid data, but a better practice would be to return {{np_nan}}, which will be seen in section [](numpy_inf_nan.md). Simply return 0 for now since we have not covered NumPy yet.

```{code-cell} ipython3

def calculate_step_length(y, step):
    """
    Calculate the step length of a given step.

    Parameters
    ----------
    y : list[float]
        A list of every heel strike's y coordinates for a given recording.
    step : int
        The index of the step we want to calculate, the first step being 0.

    Returns
    -------
    float
        The requested step length, or 0 if this step could not be calculated.
    """
    if step + 1 < len(y):
        return y[step + 1] - y[step]
    else:
        return 0.0


# Test it
print(calculate_step_length(y, 0))
print(calculate_step_length(y, 1))
print(calculate_step_length(y, 2))
print(calculate_step_length(y, 9))
```
