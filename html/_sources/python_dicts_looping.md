# Looping through a dictionary's entries

Similar to lists, we can loop through every element of a dictionary using the `for` instruction. The variable returned by `for` is the key. For example, to loop over every key of this dictionary:

```{code-cell} ipython3
dict_of_anything = {
    1: "String for integer key 1",
    2: "String for integer key 2",
    "three": "String for string key 'three'",
    "some_int_value": 10,
    "some_float_value": 10.0,
    "some_list": [1, 3, 5, 7],
    "some_nested_dict": {
        "a": "A",
        "b": "B",
    },
}
```

we would do:

```{code-cell} ipython3
for key in dict_of_anything:
    print(f"Key {key} contains this value: {dict_of_anything[key]}")
```
