# Numbers

Up to now, we referred to numbers simply as "numbers". In reality, numbers belong to different sets, each fulfilling a different role. Python provides three sets of numbers:

- Integer numbers: `int`
- Real numbers: `float`
- Complex numbers: `complex`

```{figure-md} fig_number_sets

The three sets of numbers in Python.

We will however focus only on `int` and `float`.
