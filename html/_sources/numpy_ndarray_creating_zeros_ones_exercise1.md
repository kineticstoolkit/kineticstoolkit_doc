# Exercise: Creating arrays using zeros and ones 1

We recorded the force measured by a dynamometer at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz, during 2.5 seconds. Unfortunately, the dynamometer was not plugged in, and we only recorded a series of zeros.

Using one line of code, create a NumPy array named `force` that contains this series of zeros.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]
import numpy as np

# The number of points is 2.5 * 100Hz = 250.

force = np.zeros(250)

force
```
