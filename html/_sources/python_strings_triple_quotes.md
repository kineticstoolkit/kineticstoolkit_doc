# Creating strings using triple-quotes

Python provides another type of string delimiter: the triple-quote. A string defined using triple-quotes can integrate both single and double quotes in the same string without using backslash. Line breaks are also saved in the string.

```{code-cell}
s1 = """I didn't write "E = mc2", that's Einstein's thing."""

print(s1)
```

The most common use for triple-quotes are [docstrings](python_functions_docstrings.md), which will be seen later.

```{code-cell} ipython3
s2 = """I ate your sandwich.
It was good."""

print(s2)
```
