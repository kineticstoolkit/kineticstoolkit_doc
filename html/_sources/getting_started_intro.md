# Introduction

This book is a free and continuously improving tool for learning how to perform biomechanical analyses using Python. It requires no prior programming experience, as it covers everything from installing a Python distribution to performing three-dimensional analyses on time-varying data.

**Part I** presents how to create a working environment and navigate the Spyder interface to write and execute your first program.

**Part II** covers the basics of Python, Matplotlib, and NumPy for general data processing. It includes numerous exercises that you can complete as you progress through the sections.

**Part III** delves into topics related to biomechanics, such as time series analysis, filtering, 3D geometry, marker reconstruction techniques, and more. It also explains how to perform these operations using the open-source `kineticstoolkit` package:
