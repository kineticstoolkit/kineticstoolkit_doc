# Exercise: Creating and accessing dictionaries 1

Here is a list of dictionaries that contain personal information about the participants of a research project:

```{code-cell} ipython3
participants = [
    {"ID": 101, "Sex": "F", "Height": 1.45, "Weight": 56.0},
    {"ID": 125, "Sex": "M", "Height": 1.72, "Weight": 72.0},
    {"ID": 126, "Sex": "M", "Height": 1.85, "Weight": 94.0},
    {"ID": 132, "Sex": "F", "Height": 1.82, "Weight": 80.0},
]
```

Write code that calculates the average height among all participants. The number of participants may vary; therefore, your function should work for lists of any length.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# Calculate the sum
total = 0
for participant in participants:
    total += participant["Height"]

# Divide by the number of participants
average = total / len(participants)

# Show the result
print(f"The average height is {average} m.")
```
