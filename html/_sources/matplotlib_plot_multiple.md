# Plotting multiple series

Many series can be plotted on the same figure, simply by calling `plt.plot` multiple times:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

x = [0.0, 5.0, 10.0, 15.0, 20.0]
y1 = [0.0, 1.0, 4.0, 3.0, -2.0]
y2 = [1.0, 2.0, 3.0, 4.0, 5.0]

plt.plot(x, y1)
plt.plot(x, y2);
```

By default, any new plot is added to the same figure. To generate new figures, you may use the following functions:

- {{plt_figure}} prepares a new, empty figure that will be used for each subsequent plot, leaving the original one intact.
- {{plt_clf}} clears the current figure.
