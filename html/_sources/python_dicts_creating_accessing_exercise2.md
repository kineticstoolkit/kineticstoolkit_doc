# Exercise: Creating and accessing dictionaries 2

We have a list of dictionaries that contain personal information about the participants of a research project:

```{code-cell} ipython3
participants = [
    {"ID": 101, "Sex": "F", "Height": 1.45, "Weight": 56.0},
    {"ID": 125, "Sex": "M", "Height": 1.72, "Weight": 72.0},
    {"ID": 126, "Sex": "M", "Height": 1.85, "Weight": 94.0},
    {"ID": 132, "Sex": "F", "Height": 1.82, "Weight": 80.0},
]
```

Write code that iterates through all elements of this list to create a new list that contains only the participants' IDs: `[101, 125, 126, 132]`.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# Initialize an empty list
ids = []

for participant in participants:
    ids.append(participant["ID"])

# Show the result
ids
```
