# Exercise: Arithmetics

A ball is released from a point in the air. Knowing that it was immobile when released, and that it gains negative speed at a rate of 9.81 m/sÂ², plot its velocity as shown in {numref}`fig_falling_ball` for one second after release.

```{figure-md} fig_falling_ball
:width: 3in
![](_static/images/fig_falling_ball.png)

Vertical velocity of a falling ball.
```

::::{tip}
:::{toggle}
Start by creating a time array using {{np_arange}} or {{np_linspace}}. Then, use this time array to create a velocity array. Finally, plot the velocity as a function of time.

```{code-cell} ipython3

import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# First, let's define a time array
t = np.linspace(0, 1, 100, endpoint=False)

# Calculate the velocity as -9.81 * t
v = -9.81 * t

# Show it
plt.plot(t, v)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Velocity (m/s)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.show()
```
