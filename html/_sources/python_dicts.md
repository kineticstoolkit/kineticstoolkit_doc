# Dictionaries

The last fundamental built-in Python type is the dictionary (`dict`). Like lists and tuples, a dictionary contains any number of elements. However, lists and tuples store elements in a sequential way that we address using indices or slices, whereas dictionaries store elements non-sequentially using keys. This section introduces how to create, read, and modify dictionaries.

If you come from Matlab, Python's `dict` fulfills the same role as Matlab's `struct`.
