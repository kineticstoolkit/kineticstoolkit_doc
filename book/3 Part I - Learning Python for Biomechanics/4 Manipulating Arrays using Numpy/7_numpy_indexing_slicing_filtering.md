# Indexing, slicing and filtering arrays


## Indexing and slicing one-dimensional arrays

Indexing and slicing a one-dimensional array is identical to indexing a [Python list](../2%20Learning%20Python/6_python_lists.md).

:::{tip}
As a reminder:

- Indexing means accessing one element using an index: `the_array[2]`
- Slicing means accessing several elements using a slice: `the_array[0:3]`
:::

Throughout this section, we will work with two example arrays:
- `data`: some random data;
- `time`: the corresponding time.

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.array([0.0, 0.58, 0.95, 0.95, 0.58, 0.0, -0.59, -0.96, -0.96, -0.59])
time = np.arange(10) / 10

plt.plot(time, data, "s-")
plt.grid(True);
```

As mentioned above, **indexing** a one-dimensional array is identical to [indexing a list](../2%20Learning%20Python/python_lists_indexing.md). To read one element of a list/array:

```{code-cell} ipython3
data[2]  # Read the 3rd element
```

To write one element of a list/array:

```{code-cell} ipython3
data[2] = 0.58  # Assign 0.35 to the 3rd element

# Plot the result
plt.plot(time, data, "s-")
plt.grid(True)

data[2] = 0.95  # Reset to its original value
```

Negative indexing also works:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Read the last data
data[-1]
```


**Slicing** a one-dimensional array is identical to [slicing a list](../2%20Learning%20Python/python_lists_slicing.md). To read several elements of a list/array:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Keep only the values at indexes 2, 4, 6 and 8 of the original array
# Start at 2 (incl.), up to 9 (excl.) by steps of 2:
data_subset = data[2:9:2]
time_subset = time[2:9:2]

# Plot the result
plt.plot(time, data, "s-", label="original data")
plt.plot(time_subset, data_subset, "o-", label="subset")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend();
```

To write several elements of a list/array:

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Replace values at indexes 2, 4, 6, 8 of the original list/array by
# [-0.7, -0.8, -0.9, -1.0]

modified_data = data.copy()
modified_data[2:9:2] = [-0.7, -0.8, -0.9, -1.0]

# Plot the result
plt.plot(time, data, "s-", label="original data")
plt.plot(time, modified_data, "o-", label="modified data")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend();
```


:::{tip}
Note the line:

```
modified_data = data.copy()
```

Using the {{ndarray_copy}} method is required here, because otherwise we are just telling Python to assign an additional name (`modified_data`) to the same variable (`data`). In this case, modifying `modified_data` would also modify `data` since they are both the same array. Using the `copy` method creates a new, unique array so that modifying one won't modify the other.
:::


## 💪 Exercise 1

You used an accelerometer to detect a small movement. The acceleration returned by the instrument is expressed by this list, at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz.

```{code-cell} ipython3
acc = [0.01, 0.01, 0.00, 0.00, 0.02, 0.77, 0.82, 0.86, 0.81, 0.74, 0.07, 0.02]
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

acc = np.array(acc)
time = np.arange(acc.shape[0]) / 100

plt.plot(time, acc, "o-r")
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Acceleration")
plt.grid(True);
```

However, by carefully inspecting your signal, you realize that the data is late by 40 milliseconds. You want to fix this delay, but you also want to keep the same number of samples in your signal.

- Using NumPy slicing, write a code that moves forward every data by 40 ms.
- Fill the missing data at the end with zeros.

In summary, you want to produce the blue curve below:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

new_acc = acc.copy()
new_acc[0:-4] = acc[4:]
new_acc[-5:] = 0

time = np.arange(acc.shape[0]) / 100
fig = plt.figure()
plt.plot(time, acc, "o-r")
plt.plot(time, new_acc, "o--b")
plt.plot(
    np.array([5, 2, 3, 2, 3, 2, 5]) / 100,
    [0.4, 0.4, 0.5, 0.4, 0.3, 0.4, 0.4],
    "k",
    linewidth=5,
)
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.ylabel("Acceleration")
plt.grid(True);
```

::::{tip}

Do not forget to convert the list to an array.

Separate the problem in two separate steps. First shift the signal, then fill the rest of the signal with zeroes. It is suggested to plot the intermediary result between both steps.

Shifting the signal is equivalent to reading a certain portion of the signal, and then assign this portion to another portion of the signal.

::::

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


# Convert acc to an array
acc = np.array(acc)

# We will plot intermediary steps, to better visualize what we do.
plt.subplot(1, 3, 1)
plt.plot(acc, "o-")
plt.title("Original signal")

# STEP 1 - Shift the signal.
#
# At 100 Hz, the sampling period is 1/100 = 0.01. Therefore, 40 ms is 4 samples.
# We need to shift the acceleration by -4 samples. In other words, we need to
# assign acc[from sample 4 to the end] to acc[from sample 0 to the end-4]
acc[:-4] = acc[4:]

# Plot the new signal
plt.subplot(1, 3, 2)
plt.plot(acc, "o-")
plt.title("Shifted signal")

# STEP 2 - Fill the rest with zeros
acc[-4:] = 0

# Let's see the result
plt.subplot(1, 3, 3)
plt.plot(acc, "o-")
plt.title("End result")

plt.tight_layout();
```


## Filtering unidimensional arrays

:::{important}
This section is about manipulating NumPy arrays, and more precisely about selecting specific indexes in an array using a mask of booleans or integers. This is not about filtering a time series using a moving average or Butterworth filter, which will be seen later in section [](../../4%20Part%20II%20-%20Going%20Further%20with%20Kinetics%20Toolkit/1%20Manipulating%20Time%20Series/8_filters.md).
:::

We learned how to access **one data** using indexing, and **multiple regularly-spaced data** using slicing. To read **multiple non-regularly-spaced data**, we use filtering. We call it filtering because we selectively filter out some data using a mask.

Using these NumPy arrays:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

data = np.array([0.0, 0.58, 0.95, 0.95, 0.58, 0.0, -0.59, -0.96, -0.96, -0.59])
time = np.arange(10) / 10
```

Let's say we want to keep only the following indexes:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

bool_mask = [True, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, True, True]

plt.plot(time, data, "s-")
for i, value in enumerate(bool_mask):
    if value:
        plt.text(
            time[i],
            data[i] + 0.04,
            "$\checkmark$",
            ha="center",
            fontsize=50,
            color="g",
        )
    else:
        plt.text(
            time[i], data[i] + 0.04, "x", ha="center", fontsize=30, color="r"
        )
plt.grid(True);        
```

We can create a mask to select directly which items to keep, and which items to reject.

This mask can be either a **boolean** mask, which is the same shape as `data`, and where each data to keep is True, and where each data to discard is False:

```{code-cell} ipython3
bool_mask = [True, False, False, True, False, False, False, False, True, True]
```

of an **integer** mask, where we explicitly list the indexes to keep:

```{code-cell} ipython3
int_mask = [0, 3, 8, 9]
```

In any case, we then use this mask between brackets, as we would index or slice the array:

```{code-cell} ipython3
plt.subplot(3,1,1)
plt.plot(time, data, "s-")
plt.title("Original data")

plt.subplot(3,1,2)
plt.plot(time[bool_mask], data[bool_mask], "s-")
plt.title("Filtered data, using a mask of bool")

plt.subplot(3,1,3)
plt.plot(time[int_mask], data[int_mask], "s-")
plt.title("Filtered data, using a mask of int")

plt.tight_layout();
```

:::{tip}
Since indexes can also be negative, then masks of integers can also use negative values.
:::

In section [](3_numpy_arithmetics.md), we learned how to generate arrays of bool by comparing an array to a number using comparison operators such as `==`, `<`, `>=`, etc. These comparisons are a powerful way to filter an array. For example, to keep every positive value and reject the rest:

```{code-cell} ipython3
to_keep = data >= 0  # Create a boolean mask of the values to keep
print("to_keep =", to_keep)

plt.plot(time, data, "s-", label="Original data")
plt.plot(time[to_keep], data[to_keep], "o-", label="Filtered data")
plt.legend();
```

Or, as another example, to replace any negative value by 0:

```{code-cell} ipython3
is_negative = data < 0
print("is_negative =", is_negative)

new_data = data.copy()
new_data[is_negative] = 0  

plt.plot(time, data, "s-", label="Original data")
plt.plot(time, new_data, "o-", label="New data")
plt.legend();
```


## 💪 Exercise 2

We measured the step length of a person during 10 steps. Here are these measurements:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

step_length = np.array(
    [0.707, 0.730, 0.752, 0.707, 0.691, 0.726, 0.722, 0.726, 0.710, 0.661]
)  # in meters
```

For each of these questions, write a single line of code that prints the requested step lengths.

1. From the third step up to the end;
2. The last two steps;
3. All steps, but without the first two and the last two;
4. Every other step starting from the third;
5. Steps 2, 5, 6, and 7, with step 0 being the first.
6. The first and the last.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# 1. From the third step up to the end;
print(step_length[2:])

# 2. The two last steps;
print(step_length[-2:])

# 3. All steps, but without the two firsts and the two lasts;
print(step_length[2:-2])

# 4. Every other step starting from the third;
print(step_length[2::2])

# 5. Steps 2, 5, 6, 7, with step 0 being the first.
print(step_length[[2, 5, 6, 7]])
# Note the double bracket: this is equivalent to write:
# >> mask = [2, 4, 6, 7]
# >> step_length[mask]

# 6. The first and the last.
print(step_length[[0, -1]])
```

## 💪 Exercise 3

The position of an object was recorded in meters over one second at a sampling frequency of 100 Hz:

```
import numpy as np

p = np.array(
    [
        0.    , 0.0099, 0.0196, 0.0291, 0.0384, 0.0475, 0.0564, 0.0651,
        0.0736, 0.0819, 0.09  , 0.0979, 0.1056, 0.1131, 0.1204, 0.1275,
        0.1344, 0.1411, 0.1476, 0.1539, 0.16  , 0.1659, 0.1716, 0.1771,
        0.1824, 0.1875, 0.1924, 0.1971, 0.2016, 0.2059, 0.21  , 0.2139,
        0.2176, 0.2211, 0.2244, 0.2275, 0.2304, 0.2331, 0.2356, 0.2379,
        0.24  , 0.2419, 0.2436, 0.2451, 0.2464, 0.2475, 0.2484, 0.2491,
        0.2496, 0.2499, 0.25  , 0.2499, 0.2496, 0.2491, 0.2484, 0.2475,
        0.2464, 0.2451, 0.2436, 0.2419, 0.24  , 0.2379, 0.2356, 0.2331,
        0.2304, 0.2275, 0.2244, 0.2211, 0.2176, 0.2139, 0.21  , 0.2059,
        0.2016, 0.1971, 0.1924, 0.1875, 0.1824, 0.1771, 0.1716, 0.1659,
        0.16  , 0.1539, 0.1476, 0.1411, 0.1344, 0.1275, 0.1204, 0.1131,
        0.1056, 0.0979, 0.09  , 0.0819, 0.0736, 0.0651, 0.0564, 0.0475,
        0.0384, 0.0291, 0.0196, 0.0099
    ]
)
```

Knowing that:

$$
v(i) = \dfrac{p(i+1) - p(i-1)}{t(i+1) - t(i-1)}
$$

Write a program of only 1 to 2 lines that calculates the speed of the object. Then, plot the velocity and position on the same figure to check your result.

:::{tip}
Due to the calculation of speed requiring position values before and after the current sample, the velocity array will be 2 values shorter than the position array, as illustrated in {numref}`fig_speed_calculation`.
:::

```{figure}
:label: fig_speed_calculation
:width: 6in
![](_static/images/fig_speed_calculation.png)

Calculating speed leads to a shorter array.
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-cell]
import numpy as np

t = np.arange(100) / 100
p = t - t**2
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

t = np.arange(100) / 100
v = (p[2:] - p[0:-2]) / (t[2:] - t[0:-2])

# Since the time step is regular at 0.01, we could also calculate v using a single line:
v = (p[2:] - p[0:-2]) / (2 * 0.01)

# Plot the result
plt.plot(t, p, label="Position (m)")
plt.plot(t[1:-1], v, label="Velocity (m/s)")
plt.xlabel("Time (s)")
plt.grid(True)
plt.legend()
plt.show()
```


## 💪 Exercise 4

You have recorded a noisy signal:

```
signal = np.array(
    [
        0.436, 0.493, 0.467, 0.467, 0.482, 0.497, 0.474, 0.493, 0.474, 0.467,
        0.470, 0.455, 0.482, 0.501, 0.470, 0.482, 0.467, 0.467, 0.558, 0.413,
        0.463, 0.444, 0.463, 0.417, 0.528, 0.455, 0.486, 0.459, 0.490, 0.459,
    ]
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

signal = np.array(
    [
        0.436,
        0.493,
        0.467,
        0.467,
        0.482,
        0.497,
        0.474,
        0.493,
        0.474,
        0.467,
        0.470,
        0.455,
        0.482,
        0.501,
        0.470,
        0.482,
        0.467,
        0.467,
        0.558,
        0.413,
        0.463,
        0.444,
        0.463,
        0.417,
        0.528,
        0.455,
        0.486,
        0.459,
        0.490,
        0.459,
        0.467,
    ]
)
plt.plot(signal);
```

You want to smooth this signal using a moving average with a window of three samples. This means creating a new array where each value is the average of the three neighbour values of the raw signal, as illustrated in {numref}`fig_moving_average`.

```{figure}
:label: fig_moving_average
:width: 6in
![](_static/images/fig_moving_average.png)

Filtering using a moving average.
```


Using only one line, apply this filter to the raw, noisy signal. Then, plot both the raw and filtered signals on the same figure to verify your result.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


filtered = (signal[0:-2] + signal[1:-1] + signal[2:]) / 3

plt.plot(signal, label="raw")
plt.plot(filtered, label="filtered")
plt.legend();
```


## Indexing multidimensional arrays

In the previous section, we learned how to access one element of a one-dimensional array using indexing, and how to access multiple elements of a one-dimensional array using slicing and filtering. We will now generalize this to multidimensional arrays. Throughout this tutorial, we will use these two sample arrays:

**Sample array #1: Trajectory of a marker during three samples**

The position of a marker is expressed by three coordinates (x, y, z), usually followed by a constant value of 1. A trajectory is expressed as a series of positions. Therefore, we express the trajectory of a marker using:

- Axis 0: sample
- Axis 1: coordinate

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

import ktkdoctools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(
    position,
    title="position",
    col_labels=["x", "y", "z", "1"],
    row_labels=["Sample 0", "Sample 2", "Sample 3"],
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

position
```

**Sample array #2: Series of segment orientation during two samples**

The orientation of a segment is expressed as a 4x4 homogeneous matrix. Therefore, we can express a series of orientations using:

- Axis 0: sample
- Axis 1: line of the homogeneous transform matrix
- Axis 2: column of the homogeneous transform matrix

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

orientation = np.array(
    [
        [
            [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
        ],
        [
            [1.0, 0.000, 0.000, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.999, -0.017, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.017, 0.999, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.000, 0.000, 1.0],
        ],
    ]
)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
tbl0 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(
    orientation[0],
    title="orientation at sample 0",
    width=5,
    row_labels=["L0", "L1", "L2", "L3"],
    col_labels=["C0", "C1", "C2", "C3"],
)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
tbl1 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(
    orientation[1],
    title="orientation at sample 1",
    width=5,
    row_labels=["L0", "L1", "L2", "L3"],
    col_labels=["C0", "C1", "C2", "C3"],
)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
orientation = np.array(
    [
        [
            [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
        ],
        [
            [1.0, 0.000, 0.000, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.999, -0.017, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.017, 0.999, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.000, 0.000, 1.0],
        ],
    ]
)

orientation
```


As for one-dimensional arrays, we index multidimensional arrays using integers in brackets. Using a single integer indexes the first dimension. For example:

### Example 1: Read the marker position at first sample

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

import ktkdoctools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(
    position,
    title="position",
)

# Highlight the first line
for i in range(4):
    tbl[0, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

position[0]
```

### Example 2: Read the marker position at second sample

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(
    position,
    title="position",
)

# Highlight the second line
for i in range(4):
    tbl[1, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)


plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: []

position[1]
```

Notice how indexing an array reduces its dimension by one. In the example above, we indexed the second row of a 2D array, which returned a 1D array that corresponds to the four columns of this row. Therefore, to also select a column, we can index the result:

### Example 3: Read the marker's z coordinate at second sample

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(position, title="position")
tbl[1, 2].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_1)
tbl[1, 0].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
tbl[1, 1].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
tbl[1, 3].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
position[1][2]
```

This is perfectly valid. However, we normally use commas `,` to directly access the specified value:

```{code-cell} ipython3
position[1, 2]
```

Both notations are equivalent, but the second one is more powerful (as we will see later in section [](numpy_slicing_nd.md)). It also makes it clearer that we index one whole array, and not a list that is nested into another list.

### Example 4: Read the segment's orientation at second sample

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

orientation = np.array(
    [
        [
            [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
        ],
        [
            [1.0, 0.000, 0.000, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.999, -0.017, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.017, 0.999, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.000, 0.000, 1.0],
        ],
    ]
)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
tbl0 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(orientation[0], title="orientation[0]", width=5)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
tbl1 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(orientation[1], title="orientation[1]", width=5)

# Highlight the whole second matrix
for i in range(4):
    for j in range(4):
        tbl1[i, j].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
# Orientation of the segment at second sample
orientation = np.array(
    [
        [
            [1.0, 0.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 1.0, 0.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 1.0, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0],
        ],
        [
            [1.0, 0.000, 0.000, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.999, -0.017, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.017, 0.999, 0.0],
            [0.0, 0.000, 0.000, 1.0],
        ],
    ]
)

orientation[1]
```

### Example 5: Read the 3rd line of the segment's orientation matrix at second sample

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
tbl0 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(orientation[0], title="orientation[0]", width=5)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
tbl1 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(orientation[1], title="orientation[1]", width=5)

for i in range(4):
    tbl1[0, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
    tbl1[1, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
    tbl1[2, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_1)
    tbl1[3, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
orientation[1, 2]
```

### Example 6: Read 3rd line, 2nd column of the segment's orientation matrix at 2nd sample

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

plt.subplot(1, 2, 1)
tbl0 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(orientation[0], title="orientation[0]", width=5)

plt.subplot(1, 2, 2)
tbl1 = ktkdoctools.draw_table(orientation[1], title="orientation[1]", width=5)

for i in range(4):
    tbl1[0, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
    tbl1[1, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
    tbl1[2, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_1)
    tbl1[3, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

tbl1[2, 1].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_2)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
orientation[1, 2, 1]
```


## Slicing multidimensional arrays

We just learned how to index multidimensional matrices using indices separated by commas. Slicing works the same way: for a given dimension, all we need is to use a slice instead of an index.

### Example 7: Read the marker's y coordinate at samples 0 and 1

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

import ktkdoctools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(position, title="position")

# Highlight the second line
for i in range(2):
    tbl[i, 1].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

position[0:2, 1]
```

### Example 8: Read the marker's y and z coordinates at samples 0 and 1

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(position, title="position")

# Highlight the second line
for i in range(2):
    for j in range(1, 3):
        tbl[i, j].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
position[0:2, 1:3]
```

:::{tip}
A slice can be as simple as a colon operator `:`. This is a slice with no bounds, which literally means from the beginning up to the end. In other words, "all data on this axis".
:::

### Example 9: Read the marker's z coordinate at all samples

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(position, title="position")

# Highlight the second line
for i in range(3):
    tbl[i, 2].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
position[:, 2]
```

## Filtering multidimensional arrays

We learned above how to use lists of booleans and lists of integers to filter one-dimensional arrays. This also works on multidimensional arrays, although filtering on axes other than the first is somewhat unintuitive and can result in unexpected array shapes. Fortunately, in biomechanical data processing, filtering often occurs on the first axis, which typically corresponds to time.

### Example 10: Read the marker coordinates at samples 0 and 2

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]

import ktkdoctools
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

tbl = ktkdoctools.draw_table(position, title="position")

# Highlight the second line
for i in range(4):
    tbl[0, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)
    tbl[2, i].set_facecolor(ktkdoctools.HIGHLIGHT_BLUE_0)

plt.show()
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

position = np.array(
    [
        [0.497, 0.973, 0.010, 1.0],
        [0.528, 0.973, 0.017, 1.0],
        [0.589, 0.970, 0.025, 1.0],
    ]
)

mask = [0, 2]
position[mask]
```

or directly:

```{code-cell} ipython3
position[[0, 2]]
```


## 💪 Exercise 5

We recorded this series of forces using force platform during gait, where the first axis represents time and the second axis represents the three force components $F_x$, $F_y$ and $F_z$.

Write a code that calculates the mean of $F_x$, but only during the weight support phase. We consider that the weight support phase occurs when $F_z > 10$.

Follow these steps:

1. Isolate the weight support phase using $F_z$;
2. Isolate $F_x$ during this phase;
3. Calculate the average of $F_x$.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]

# Step 1

# We create a mask to keep only the weight support phase
is_weight_support_phase = forces[:, 2] > 10

# Step 2

# We isolate Fx during this phase
f_x = forces[is_weight_support_phase, 0]

# Step 3

# We calculate the average
print(np.mean(f_x))
```
