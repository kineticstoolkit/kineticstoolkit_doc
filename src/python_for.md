# Looping using **for**

We learned to use [while](python_while.md) to repeat a code block as long as a condition is true. While the `while` statement is very powerful and sufficient for any looping, it is sometimes clearer to use the `for` statement instead.

The `for` statement means: "repeat this code block for each element in this variable".

This allows us to easily iterate through each element of a list:

```
for variable_name in the_list:
    instruction1()
    instruction2()
    instruction3()
    etc.
```

For example:

```{code-cell}
a_list = [0, 1, 2, 'three', 'four']

for item in a_list:
    print("The current item is:", item)

print("done.")
```
