# Where to start

Depending on your background, you may want to start your journey at different points:

:::::{tab-set}

::::{tab-item} I never programmed using Python.
:::{card}
Simply start at the beginning: [](getting_started_installing.md).
:::
::::

::::{tab-item} I know Python, Numpy and Matplotlib, but I'm new to biomechanical analysis.
:::{card}
- You may be interested in a refresher by attempting these different [programming exercises](python_exercises.md).
- Then, jump to [](ktk_importing.md).
:::
::::

::::{tab-item} I already do biomechanical analysis, but under Matlab instead of Python.
:::{card}
- You may want to start at the beginning to learn the Python syntax: [](getting_started_installing.md).
- You may skip [](matplotlib.md) as this is practically identical to Matlab.
- However, be sure to go through [](numpy.md) as there are some fundamental differences between Matlab and NumPy.
- Then, jump to [](ktk_importing.md).
