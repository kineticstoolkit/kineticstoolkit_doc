# Arithmetics

All Python arithmetic operators (`+`, `-`, `*`, `/`, `**`) work directly on NumPy arrays, assuming both arrays have the same shape. Operations are performed between corresponding elements of the same position. For example, using `a + b`, the 1st element of `a` is summed with the 1st element of `b`, the 2nd element of `a` with the 2nd of `b`, and so on:

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

a = np.array(
    [
        [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
        [1.0, 2.0, 3.0],
    ]
)

b = np.array(
    [
        [1.0, 1.0, 1.0],
        [2.0, 2.0, 2.0],
    ]
)
```

**Addition**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a + b
```

**Subtraction**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a - b
```

**Multiplication**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a * b
```

**Division**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a / b
```

**Exponent**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a**b
```

It is also possible to perform operations between an array and a single number.

**Addition**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a + 1
```

**Subtraction**:

```{code-cell} ipython3
a - 1
```

and so on.
