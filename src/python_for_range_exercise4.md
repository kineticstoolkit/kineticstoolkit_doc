# Exercise: Looping using **for** and **range** 4

Knowing that:

```{math}
\text{speed}(t) = \left( {\text{position}(t+1) - \text{position}(t-1)} \right) * \dfrac{\text{sampling frequency}}{2}
```

write this function:

```
def calculate_speed(position, sampling_frequency):
    """
    Calculate speed based on position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : list[float]
        A list of positions in metres.
    sampling_frequency : float
        The frequency at which the positions were measured in Hz.

    Returns
    -------
    list[float]
        A list of speeds in m/s. This list is the same size as `position`.
        Since speed cannot be calculated for the first and last times, values
        of zero are returned for these times.
    
    """
```

and test it with the following position values that were sampled at 100 Hz:

```{code-cell}
list_of_positions = [
    30.5, 30.511, 30.523, 30.535, 30.548, 30.56, 30.572, 30.584, 30.595, 30.606,
    30.619, 30.631, 30.645, 30.658, 30.672, 30.687, 30.702, 30.716, 30.731,
    30.746, 30.763, 30.779, 30.795, 30.81, 30.824, 30.838, 30.853, 30.868, 30.884,
    30.901, 30.917, 30.934, 30.951, 30.969, 30.988, 31.006, 31.024, 31.042, 31.059,
    31.076, 31.092, 31.109, 31.125, 31.143, 31.161, 31.178, 31.196, 31.214, 31.232,
    31.25
]
```

:::{tip}
It will be impossible to calculate speed for the first sample because it would require the position before the first sample. It will also be impossible to calculate speed for the last sample because it would require the position after the last sample. Simply fill the first and last samples of the speed with zero as shown in {numref}`fig_padding_speed_with_zero`.
