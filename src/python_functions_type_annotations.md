# Type annotations

In addition to [docstrings](python_functions_docstrings.md), type annotations (also called type hints) are increasingly popular to document the types of a function's parameters and return value.

:::{good-practice} Docstring vs type annotations
Always write a good docstring in the first place. Type annotations are much more optional, and at this point, knowing about type annotations is important mainly to read Python packages documentation.
:::

Type annotation allows documenting the types directly in the function signature instead of the docstring. They use `:` to document parameter types, and `->` to document return value types (see the `->` as a right-arrow):

```
def format_info(
    i_participant: int,
    first_name: str,
    last_name: str,
    age: float,
    height: float,
    weight: float
) -> str:
    """
