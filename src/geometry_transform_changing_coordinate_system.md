# The homogeneous transform: mapping coordinates to other coordinate systems

In section [](geometry_basics.md), we learned about the homogeneous transform, which is a 4x4 matrix that defines the **position and orientation of a coordinate system with respect to a reference coordinate system.**

In section [](geometry_transform_changing_coordinate_system.md), we learned that the same 4x4 matrix can also be defined as a **translation and rotation of a point, vector, or transform.**

In this new section, we will use both definitions to see the third and last role of the homogeneous transform, which is **remapping points, vectors, and transforms from one coordinate system to another.**
