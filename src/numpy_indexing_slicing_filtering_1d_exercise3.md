# Exercise: Indexing/slicing/filtering one-dimensional arrays 3

You have recorded a noisy signal:

```
signal = np.array(
    [
        0.436, 0.493, 0.467, 0.467, 0.482, 0.497, 0.474, 0.493, 0.474, 0.467,
        0.470, 0.455, 0.482, 0.501, 0.470, 0.482, 0.467, 0.467, 0.558, 0.413,
        0.463, 0.444, 0.463, 0.417, 0.528, 0.455, 0.486, 0.459, 0.490, 0.459,
    ]
)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [remove-input]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt

signal = np.array(
    [
        0.436,
        0.493,
        0.467,
        0.467,
        0.482,
        0.497,
        0.474,
        0.493,
        0.474,
        0.467,
        0.470,
        0.455,
        0.482,
        0.501,
        0.470,
        0.482,
        0.467,
        0.467,
        0.558,
        0.413,
        0.463,
        0.444,
        0.463,
        0.417,
        0.528,
        0.455,
        0.486,
        0.459,
        0.490,
        0.459,
        0.467,
    ]
)
plt.plot(signal);
```

You want to smooth this signal using a moving average with a window of three samples. This means creating a new array where each value is the average of the three neighbour values of the raw signal, as illustrated in {numref}`fig_moving_average`.

```{figure-md} fig_moving_average
:width: 6in
![](_static/images/fig_moving_average.png)

Filtering using a moving average.
```


Using only one line, apply this filter to the raw, noisy signal. Then, plot both the raw and filtered signals on the same figure to verify your result.

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [hide-cell]
import numpy as np
import matplotlib.pyplot as plt


filtered = (signal[0:-2] + signal[1:-1] + signal[2:]) / 3

plt.plot(signal, label="raw")
plt.plot(filtered, label="filtered")
plt.legend();
```
