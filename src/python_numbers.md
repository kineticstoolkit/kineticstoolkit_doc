# Numbers

Until now, we referred to numbers simply as "numbers". In reality, numbers belong to different sets, each fulfilling a different role. Python provides three sets of numbers:

- Integer numbers: `int`
- Real numbers: `float`
- Complex numbers: `complex`

```{figure-md} fig_number_sets
:width: 6in

The three sets of numbers in Python.

However, we will focus only on integers (`int`) and real numbers (`float`).
