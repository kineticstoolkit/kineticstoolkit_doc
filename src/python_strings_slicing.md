# Indexing and slicing strings

We learned how to index and slice lists. The exact same behaviour applies to strings: we can extract one or many characters from a string by slicing it:

```{code-cell} ipython3
string = "This is a sample string that we will index and slice"

# Get the first character
print(string[0])

# Get the last character
print(string[-1])

# Get the first 10 characters
print(string[:10])

# Get the last 10 characters
print(string[-10:])

# Get every other character
print(string[::2])
```
