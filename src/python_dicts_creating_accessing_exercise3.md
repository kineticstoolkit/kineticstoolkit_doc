# Exercise: Creating and accessing dictionaries 3

Someone pushes a carriage using a dynamometer as pictured in {numref}`fig_carriage_dynamometer`. The push force and position are measured in newtons and metres every tenth of a second, during five seconds.

```{code-cell}
push_force = [
    91.19, 99.22, 93.11, 91.76, 94.93, 96.54, 92.27, 96.01, 92.48,
    94.89, 91.55, 90.82, 97.91, 93.19, 95.65, 93.07, 93.65, 90.57,
    98.71, 99.97, 95.72, 96.27, 92.67, 93.4 , 98.84, 92.63, 97.03,
    93.93, 98.34, 95.82, 99.39, 99.29, 92.74, 90.29, 94.57, 90.69,
    93.16, 95.01, 93.16, 97.04, 97.23, 98.9 , 90.26, 97.46, 92.4 ,
    90.84, 97.39, 93.56, 97.47, 93.93

carriage_position = [
    111.5, 111.613, 111.73, 111.852, 111.98, 112.103, 112.225, 112.34,

    118.826, 119.001
 ]
```

Write a function named `calculate_speed_and_power` with the following docstring:

```
def calculate_speed_and_power(force, position, sampling_frequency):
    """
    Calculate speed and power based on force and position.

    Parameters
    ----------
    force : list[float]
        A list of forces in newtons.
    position : list[float]
        A list of positions in meters. Its length must be the same as `force`.
    sampling_frequency : float
        The frequency at which the positions were measured in Hz.
        
    Returns
    -------
    list[dict]
        A list of the same length of `force` and `position`, that contains
        dictionaries with the following keys:
        - "Force": force in newtons
        - "Position": position in meters
        - "Speed": speed in m/s
        - "Power": power in watts.

    Example
    -------
    To get the power at the 5th sample, we would do:
    >>> data = calculate_speed_and_power(force, position, sampling_frequency)
    >>> power_5th_sample = data[4]["Power"]

    """
```

:::{tip}
You are strongly encouraged to reuse the functions `calculate_speed` and `calculate_power` that you wrote in [](python_for_range_exercise3.md) and [](python_for_range_exercise4.md).

    Parameters
    ----------
    position : list[float]

    Returns
    -------
    list[float]
