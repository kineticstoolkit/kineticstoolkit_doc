# Comments

Programs with only a few lines of code are generally easy to understand. As they grow in complexity, we need to document them, usually with comments.

Any text that follows `#` corresponds to a comment, and it is not executed by Python. Usually, we use comments to explain the objective of a section of code.

These codes are completely equivalent:

**Without comments**

```{code-cell}
print("Here is a calculation")
print(10 + 5)
```


**With comments**

```{code-cell}
# Demonstrate comments

print("Here is a calculation")  # Print some text
print(10 + 5)  # Print the result of an addition
```
