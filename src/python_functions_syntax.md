# 📖 Function syntax

:::{card} Summary
This section presents how to declare and implement functions, and how to pass parameters to these functions.
:::

## 📄 Defining a function

In python, functions are defined using this syntax:

```
def function_name(arg1, arg2, ...):
    # operation1
    # operation2
    # operation3
    # etc.
    return the_result
```

This reads as "Define the function `function_name`, which takes `arg1`, `arg2`, ... as input. This function will process these inputs and return `the_result` as an output.

Here is a very basic example of a function that prints its input values and their sum:

```{code-cell}
def print_sum(arg1, arg2):
    print("Hi!")
    print(f"The first variable is {arg1}.")
    print(f"The second variable is {arg2}.")
    print(f"The sum of both variables is {arg1 + arg2}.")
```

Once a function is defined (using the `def` keyword), it can then be called as many times as we want:

```{code-cell}
print_sum(1, 4)
print_sum(3, 10)
```

:::{good-practice} Function naming
Usually, function names start with an active verb that tells what action is performed by the function. Usually in python, function names are written in lower_case with words separated by underscores, like variables.
:::

## 📄 Signature and implementation

The first line of the function definition is called the **function signature**. It defines how to use the function. By reading the signature of our example, we know that the function is called `print_sum` and that it takes two arguments.

:::{note}
In the different references found on the web, we often see both the terms "argument" and "parameter" for function inputs. Both terms are equivalent and will be used interchangeably.
:::

Note the colon `:` that terminates the function signature. A colon indicates that the following indented lines are a code block, which is simply a series of lines that belong to a same group. In the case of a function, this code block is the **function implementation**. This is the lines to be executed when the function is called. In python, code blocks are delimited by their indentation. Every line of a code block must be indented with the same number of spaces.

:::{tip}
Since indentation is so important in python, practically all python editors include keyboard shortcuts to indent or outdent code blocks. In Spyder, select a group of lines that you want to indent or outdent, then press `Tab` to indent, or `Shift+Tab` to outdent.
:::

## 📄 Argument names

In the `print_sum` example, we used `arg1` and `arg2` as argument names, but any name work equally. For instance, we could also use `first` and `second`, as long as we refer to these names in the implementation:

```{code-cell}
def print_sum(first, second):
    print("Hi!")
    print(f"The first variable is {first}.")
    print(f"The second variable is {second}.")
    print(f"The sum of both variables is {first + second}.")
```

:::{good-practice} Clear argument names
It is very important to use clear names for function arguments. Argument names are selected using the same best practices as standard [variable](python_arithmetics_and_variables.md) names.
:::

## 💪 Exercise 1

Using the function `print_sum()` as an example, create a function `print_info()` which, when it is called using:

```
print_info(1, "Catherina", "Smith", 20, 1.5, 50.2)
```
    
it prints this:

    =============
    Participant 1: Catherina Smith
    20 years old
    Height: 1.5 m
    Weight: 50.2 kg
    BMI: 22.31
    =============
       
Note that the body-mass index (BMI) is calculated using $\text{weight}/\text{height}^2$.

Please use clear names for your function's arguments.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-cell]

def print_info(i_participant, first_name, last_name, age, height, weight):

    print("=============")
    print(f"Participant {i_participant}: {first_name} {last_name}")
    print(f"{age} years old")
    print(f"Height: {height} m")
    print(f"Weight: {weight} kg")
    print(f"BMI: {weight / (height ** 2):.2f}")
    print("=============")

print_info(1, "Catherina", "Smith", 20, 1.5, 50.2)
```


## 📄 Return values

Most functions do not print results in the console. Instead, they calculate something and return the result as an output. This is done using the `return` statement. Although the following function is not that useful, it illustrates how it works:

```{code-cell}
def calculate_sum(arg1, arg2):
    result = arg1 + arg2
    return result
```

Here are we call a function and use its return value:

### Example 1

```{code-cell}
print(calculate_sum(2, 6))
```

The function `calculate_sum()` is called with arguments 2 and 6. It executes, and then returns 8. Therefore, the `print()` function prints 8.

### Example 2

```{code-cell}
print(calculate_sum(calculate_sum(2, 6), 5))
```

The inner function call calls `calculate_sum()` with arguments 2 and 6. The function executes and returns 8. Then, the outer function call calls `calculate_sum()` with arguments 8 and 5. The function executes again and this time returns 13. Therefore, the `print()` function prints 13.


## 💪 Exercise 2

Program a function called `calculate_bmi` that takes a person's height and weight as arguments, and that returns the body-mass index, knowing that $\text{BMI} = \text{weight}/\text{height}^2$.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-cell]

def calculate_bmi(height, weight):
    return weight / (height ** 2)


# Let's test the function:
print(calculate_bmi(1.5, 50.2))
```


## 💪 Exercise 3

Based on the function `print_info` that you created in a previous example, create a new function `format_info` which does not print the information, but instead creates an equivalent string and returns it, so that:

```
print(format_info(1, "Catherina", "Smith", 20, 1.5, 50.2))
```
    
prints this:

    =============
    Participant 1: Catherina Smith
    20 years old
    Height: 1.5 m
    Weight: 50.2 kg
    BMI: 22.31
    =============

Instead of calculating the BMI manually in the function, use a call to the `calculate_bmi` function that you just wrote in the previous example.

:::{tip}
You may want to return to the section on [strings](python_strings.md) for a refresh on how to create long strings, f-strings, and how to add line breaks in strings.

```{code-cell}
:tags: [hide-cell]

def format_info(i_participant, first_name, last_name, age, height, weight):

    output = (
        "=============\n"
        f"Participant {i_participant}: {first_name} {last_name}\n"
        f"{age} years old\n"
        f"Height: {height} m\n"
        f"Weight: {weight} kg\n"
        f"BMI: {calculate_bmi(height, weight):.2f}\n"
        "============="
    )
    return output


print(format_info(1, "Catherina", "Smith", 20, 1.5, 50.2))

```
