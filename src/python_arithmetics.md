# Arithmetic operations

Any arithmetical operation is performed simply by writing its equation. For example, the most usual arithmetic operators are `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `**`.

::::{grid-item-card} Subtraction

4 - 3

::::{grid-item-card} Multiplication

4 * 3

::::{grid-item-card} Division
:columns: 6
```
4 / 3
```

::::{grid-item-card} Exponent
:columns: 6
To raise a value to a power (e.g., to calculate $4^2$), we would write:

```
4 ** 2
```
::::

::::{grid-item-card} Root
:columns: 6
For roots, we can exponentiate to the inverse. For example, to calculate $\sqrt{4}$, we would write:

```
4 ** (1 / 2)
```
