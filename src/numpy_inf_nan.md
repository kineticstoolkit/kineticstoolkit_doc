# Infinity and Not-A-Number (nan)

Some arithmetic operations such as division by zero lead to infinity of undertermined numbers, which normally result in an error:

```{code-cell} ipython3
:tags: [raises-exception]

1 / 0
```

Since an operation on arrays performs many operations at once, it would be inconvenient to get an error each time only a few calculations failed. For this matter, instead of generating errors, NumPy only warns and provides special constants to express infinity {{np_inf}} and undetermined numbers {{np_nan}} (not-a-number):

```{code-cell} ipython3
import numpy as np

a = np.array([0.0, 1.0, -1.0, 1.0])
b = np.array([0.0, 0.0, 0.0, 1.0])

c = a / b

c
```

To know which operations resulted in `nan` or `inf`, we use {{np_isnan}} and {{np_isinf}}:

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.isnan(c)
```

```{code-cell} ipython3
np.isinf(c)
```

:::{good-practice} Missing data
It is common in data analysis to use `np.nan` for representing missing data. For instance, we could record the (x, y, z) trajectory of a reflective marker and use (`nan`, `nan`, `nan`) when the marker is not seen by the cameras.
